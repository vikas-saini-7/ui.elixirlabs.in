To get started with Elixir UI, follow these simple steps to set up the required dependencies and add components to your project.

---

## 1. Install Dependencies

Elixir UI relies on Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for animations. Install them using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss framer-motion
```

If you don’t have Tailwind CSS configured yet, follow the official [Tailwind Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to set it up.

## 2. Add Elixir UI Components

You can add components either by:

- **Using the CLI:** Quickly pull components from the registry

  ```bash
  npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.elixirlabs.in/registry/button.json
  ```
