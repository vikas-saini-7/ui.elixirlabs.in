Elixir UI is a modern, minimal, and aesthetic React based component library designed to save you time and effort.

Building UI components from scratch is tedious and repetitive. Elixir UI solves this by offering a curated set of high-quality components you can instantly use — no guesswork, no reinventing the wheel.

Whether you prefer to add components manually or use our simple CLI tool to pull code directly from the registry, Elixir UI fits effortlessly into your workflow.

## Why Elixir UI?

### Real-World Solutions

Elixir UI was born from the frustration of building the same UI components repeatedly for different projects. We focus on practical, reusable components that solve common UI challenges without unnecessary complexity.

### Minimal & Beautiful by Default

Every component is crafted with a clean, minimal aesthetic that looks great out of the box. This lets you ship beautiful interfaces fast — while maintaining flexibility to make it truly yours.

### Fully Customizable

We understand every project is unique. That’s why all components are unstyled and built to be easily customized. Style them your way using any CSS method, extend functionality, or tweak behaviors to perfectly fit your needs.

### Flexible Usage

Use Elixir UI how you want — manually copy-paste snippets to your project or leverage our CLI to quickly grab components from the registry. No heavy installations, no bloated dependencies, just what you need.

### Thoughtfully Built

Behind the scenes, Elixir UI is constructed using best-in-class tools like Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and utility libraries to ensure performance, accessibility, and a great developer experience.
